        <h1>See Sailing</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the documentation, hopefully we can get you sorted out quickly.</p>
        <p>These documents all assume you have a valid See Sailing account. If this is not the case, create one now...</p>
        <h2>Creating an account</h2>
        <p>See Sailing is subscription software, paid for on an annual basis but with a thirty day trial period. You will need to provide valid credit card details to create an account but won't be charged if you cancel within thirty days. There is a single 'tier' subscription that applies for a single boat with no additional usage charges; and the mobile app is provided free of charge.</p>
        <p>Subscriptions are managed by Stripe and you start a new one by clicking here...</p>
        <div class="bluebox"><a href="https://buy.stripe.com/fZeaGU9KY9OCdGg6ov" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;">SUBSCRIBE</a></div>
        <p>When you've done that an email will be sent with your login details and a link to your account page (something like https://app.see-sailing.com/u/yourname). You can use this page to change your username, password and the name of your boat and this is described in detail on the <a href="management.html">management page documentation</a>.</p>
