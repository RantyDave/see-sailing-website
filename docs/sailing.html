        <h1>Events in your Sailing Data</h1>
        <p>Below are a few common events when sailing and what they look like in See Sailing...</p>
        <h2>We sailed into a hole</h2>
        <img class="left" src="sail-hole.png" alt="Sailed into a hole"/>
        <p>This peninsula (Point Jerningham) casts a savage wind hole in the Southerly. You can see the dark blotches in our stripes as we reach towards the mark, but also that as soon as we clear it, the boat picks up again nicely.</p>
        <h2>Fell out of the groove</h2>
        <img class="left" src="sail-groove.png" alt="Fell out of the groove"/>
        <p>While beating to windward the helmsman fell out of the groove. You can see from the trail that the mast popped upright and the boat slowed down. A little bear off and everything came back together again.</p>
        <h2>A tale of two tacks</h2>
        <img class="left" src="sail-two-tacks.png" alt="Two tacks"/>
        <p>We tack onto starboard (which is the biased tack). Unfortunately the yacht never really recovers and is then tacked back onto port (losing 24m in the process). This is still the 'wrong' tack by 10 degrees but at least the boat is moving again.</p>
        <h2>A larger yacht passes astern</h2>
        <img class="left" src="sail-astern.png" alt="A yacht passes astern"/>
        <p>We round the top mark accompanied by a larger yacht that casts a wind shadow. In the process of passing us the wash confuses the windex that spins round. As soon as we're in the clear the boat accelerates nicely.</p>
        <h2>A gusty run downwind</h2>
        <img class="left" src="sail-gusty.png" alt="A gusty run downwind" />
        <p>We're running downwind in heavy weather. Speed keeps dropping off but, as we can see, this aligns exactly with where there are lulls. We're not doing anything wrong, that's just what's happening.</p>
