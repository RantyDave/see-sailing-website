        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Actively seeking reseller arrangements</h1>
        <p>See Sailing is now through its first year of operations, and one of the lessons learned is that I'd like to engage with electronics resellers, consultants, sailmakers, performance coaches, and anyone whose business is to serve yacht owners who want to go fast. My proposition is simple and has three parts:</p>
        <p class="minset"><strong>Happier clients.</strong> Your clients' experience of yacht instrumentation will extend off the boat and into the clubhouse, intra-crew chat, and the all important 'bored at work' time as the mind drifts to more important matters. Reviews of last weekend's race and the crew's performance; as well as progression throughout the season can be viewed online without needing access to the boat's laptop or software installed on a corporate machine.</p>
        <p class="minset"><strong>Financial incentives.</strong> See Sailing pays a fee for referring clients onto the platform. I'll provide you with a printed QR code so client referrals happen by having them scan a card. Hardware is provided to resellers with a healthy margin, on thirty day terms and in one of five currencies.</p>
        <p class="minset"><strong>Opportunities to upsell.</strong> The ability to review data creates oppportunities to upsell additional products and services. For instance: assistance in calibrating wind sensors <a href="https://seesailing.substack.com/p/calibration">is explicitly supported</a>; a sailmaker has reported making additional sales based on See Sailing data; and the display of (for instance) attitude data can help drive sales of integrated <a href="https://www.bandg.com/bg/type/instrument-sensors-and-transducers/compass-sensors/gps-antenna-bg-zg100-module-pack/?srsltid=AfmBOoqNcJskz28Zj_dGpuSGR0locOawVKUO-YnkM-SHDftGmyRdvreA">gps/compass/attitude devices</a>.</p>
        <p>Please contact me <a href="mailto:davep@see-sailing.com">initially via email</a> so I can provide you with a copy of the fee structure and set up a call to discuss how best we can work together. I'm hoping that you'll feel comfortable contacting your existing clients regarding this, so please let me know if some aspect of the service needs refinement in order to make this happen.</p>
        <p>Thanks,<br>Dave</p>
