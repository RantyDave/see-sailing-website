        <h1 style="text-align: center;">How can we work together?</h1>
        <p>Many (maybe most) consumers of yacht electronics would rather not install it themselves, lack the time to do so, or are not able to subsequently configure and calibrate the equipment correctly. So it makes sense that the majority of the "customer facing" in our industry is done by professionals, and that these same professionals should own these relationships.</p>
        <p>So I'd like to work with you rather than market "direct to consumer". I have <em>some ideas</em> on how this would work and would like to discuss them, <a href="mailto:davep@see-sailing.com">initially via email</a>. Besides, there are significant upsides for you...</p>
        <h2>Integrators, consultants, resellers</h2>
        <p>I have no idea which is the broadly accepted term. But assuming you install/configure/calibrate/maintain electronics on behalf of clients, introducing them to See Sailing has a number of potential benefits for your business:</p>
        <p class="minset"><strong>Assistance with calibration</strong> - Currently under development is the ability to analyse log data and create suggestions for wind and compass angle offsets. I understand calibration as a whole is a big pain point and would like to focus on what we can do to address this.</p>
        <p class="minset"><strong>Upsell additional hardware</strong> - See Sailing can display data from GPS including streams such as the heel/trim and compass heading streams provided by (for instance) a <a href="https://www.bandg.com/bg/type/instrument-sensors-and-transducers/compass-sensors/gps-antenna-bg-zg100-module-pack/">B&G Z100</a>. It will also use data from log, compass, wind and rudder transducers if available, or fall back to the next best thing if not. Unlike 'gps only' software, See Sailing will use <a href="docs/referencing.html">water referenced velocity</a> and hence accurate true wind and vmg.</p>
        <p class="minset"><strong>Happier clients</strong>, perhaps most of all, with analyses that will be ready by the time they get to the bar. And potential clients can be shown <a href="https://app.see-sailing.com/b/spare/2025-1-13-15-50-46?t=1736739535.7830722&s=2&r=true&c=7034.21_-5883.69_114.78">what can be achieved</a> with a See Sailing enabled installation.</p>
        <p>I'm keen that you should feel comfortable approaching your existing clients, and would like to know how I can make this happen. So, again, <a href="mailto:davep@see-sailing.com">initially via email</a> then we can perhaps set up a call to discuss how I should best approach this.</p>
